# CVT

CVT stands for Covid Vaccine Tracker. It is a html page that is able to record self reports of individual vaccinations. It is launched through nodejs server application and uses SQLlite. The page has also been linked to Ganache via Metamask and can record entries on a blockchain demo given a metamask account.

## Installation

Requires node.js, sqlite, truffle, metamask and Ganache to be installed on local machine. 
To view please download all files.

## Contributing
Form works as intended. A useful feature could be a summary table or map of vaccinations rather than the tabulated data. Further, option to update "add to blockchain" button to "already added" to avoid multiple entries. This is currently allowed for simplicity of the demo.
