# CVT

CVT stands for Covid Vaccine Tracker. It is a html page that contains a form which records self reports of individual vaccinations.
In particular, the form records the name, surname, date of vaccination, vaccine name, and place of vaccination.
Below the form, it displays a table of info collected by the form in that session. Data on the webpage currently does not persist beyond the session.
